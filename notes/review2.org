* Types of Question
- Given a short code listing, answer some questions
  - What type or value does a certain expression evaluate to?
  - What type(s) should a variable be in a given context?
  - What sort of exception may occur at a given point?
  - What will a data structure look like after the code runs?
- Given a short code listing, write some code to extend it
  - Manipulation of strings, lists, and dictionaries/sets
  - Reading or writing files
  - Handling potential exceptions
- Given a problem statement, answer some questions
  - What information do we need to compute?
  - What kind of data structures would be best for this problem?
  - What kind of file would be best for this situation?
  - Outline a function that solve this problem

* Files
- See notes
* Exceptions
- See notes
* Strings
- See notes
* Lists
- Functions like ~map~, ~filter~, ~zip~, and ~enumerate~
- Difference between using the ~+~ operator and ~list.append()~
- Removing items, finding items, sorting and searching using ~list~ methods
- Creating new lists vs modifying existing lists
* Dictionaries and Sets
- Accessing keys, values, and key-value pairs
- Constraints on the set of keys
- Trade-off between Space and Time
* Slices
- See notes
